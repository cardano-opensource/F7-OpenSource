short description: A repository containing tools to help you work with the blockchain. Like truffle for cardano.
description: The repository contains two npm applications. The first is cardano-api, which is a wrapper around d-app wallets (cip-30), to make it easier for developer to integrate and work with them. The second is cardano-components, which give developears some ready made web-components (ie can be used with any framework, react, vue, redux, html, etc), which wrap the cardano-api, making it easier than ever to do basic functions. This project won two funding rounds, one for a plugin system, to allow users to use the app, with whatever chain-state data they want to use. It comes preinstalled with a blockfrost plugin, but more will be added in the future. The other is to automatically generate documentation websites. THis is being accomplished with TsDocs / TypeDocs.
