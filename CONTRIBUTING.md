# Short Guide for Contributors

## F7 OSDE Funded Projects

Welcome to all the members of Open Source projects approved in Catalyst Fund 7. 
To all the funded projects, we ask to:

- Provide a project description of your project under the folder [F7-OpenSource/funded/](funded/)
- Join our meetings to meet the Challenge Team. Once a month, we're having two sessions. Just join one. 


### Project Descripiton
The project description is your visit card to present the project to the cardano community who voted for you.
For the description you can use [funded/_example-project-readme.md](_example-project-readme.md) as an example. 

### Challenge Team Meetings
We hold two metings a month. The idea is to meet a delegate for each project at least once a month.
